# Module 2 
  From this module I've learn about ***Chunk*** ,it is a group of data which wired together and could increase it size larger and larger as long as we learn ,work ,play
and gain more data.To effectively build our own chunk we need to stay focused and try to understanding ,try to review and try to do whatever it is ,maybe you try
to playing a keyboard first you need to try to play ,secondly try to understand what're you playing and in the end you need to practice which is same as review to make
your keyboard skill better and better.The next part is ***Recall*** which is how you review what you've just study in the class without opening the book of anything you've been
noted.This method would make you understand much more and last much longer in your memories.Last but not least I've learn about ***Illution of Competence*** which is how you
misunderstood that you already understand what you've learn but in reality you don't.To avoid this Illution we need to try and so something challenging by ourself to make sure
that we really understand it and pass our midterm exam :].
